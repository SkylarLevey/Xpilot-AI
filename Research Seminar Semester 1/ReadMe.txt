makeNewNet.py creates the text file that represents the neural net and it is necessary to run before running fileTest.py

fileTest.py contains the rules agent and the learning code, run it by itself and each frame the neural net will be slightly adjusted

learnedNet.py is where the net itself can be run to see how well it learned to drive. open the txt that contains the neural net and paste the contents into the AI_loop method assigned to the variable weight.
