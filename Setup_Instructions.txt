Instructions for getting setup in Xpilot-AI

Xpilot-AI GitLab
https://gitlab.com/xpilot-ai/xpilot-ai

Download the following:
binaries/xpilot
binaries/xpilots
binaries/libpyAI.so
archives/maps.tar.gz
exampleBots/python/Spinner.py

Open a terminal and cd to the location of the files you downloaded (for example):
cd Downloads/

Now we have to make xpilot (the client) and xpilots (the server) executable by running the following commands:
chmod +x xpilot
chmod +x xpilots

Then extract the maps for the server to the same location as xpilots either by navigating to the file, double-clicking, and exporting, or by running the following command:
tar -xzf maps.tar.gz

You can run a server with the following command:
./xpilots -map maps/simple.xp -noQuit -switchBase 1
(Press Ctrl+C in the same terminal window to stop the server)

You can run the XPilot client simply by navigating to xpilot and double-clicking on it or in a new terminal running: ./xpilot

Once the xpilot window opens, click on Local, then localhost to join your server!
The keys a and s turn left and right, while shift thrusts and enter fires.

To run the Spinner bot, open a terminal, cd to the directory with Spinner and libpyAI.so, then run:
python3 Spinner.py
