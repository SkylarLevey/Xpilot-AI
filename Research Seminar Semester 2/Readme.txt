This is the progression of the pair of teaching (rules agent) and learning (neural net agent) over the course of the semester.

_Learning+Agent files contain the teaching agent and the neural net code that observes and learns from them.

_Test_Learned files contain the code to insert and then test how well the given net drives after it has learned for a while.

refresh (resets the weight files).py does just that - however it is important to note that two files are created as I would often run two of the same agent at a time to test, so just make sure you check which one the given file is editing
